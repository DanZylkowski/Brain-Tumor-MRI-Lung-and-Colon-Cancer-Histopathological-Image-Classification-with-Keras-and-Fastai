## Problem Statement

According to the [American Cancer Society estimates](https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2020/cancer-statistics-presentation-2020.pptx), in the year 2021 Lung and Colon cancer will account for approximately 20% of all cancer diagnoses, and approximately 30% of all cancer deaths. Early detection and diagnosis of cancerous tumors are the most critical factors for the successful treatment of cancer. A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of cells, but not all tumors are cancerous. Medical imaging is one way to identify cancerous tumors, and two common medical imaging methods used are Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/understanding-your-diagnosis/tests/mri-for-cancer.html) and [histopathology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology). Manually identifying the different types of cancerous tumors can be a difficult task.  

The purpose of this project is to examine the following three scenarios:
1. If a deep learning model can be created to accurately classify brain tumor MRI images into one of four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or benign.
2. If a deep learning model can be created to accurately classify if colon tissue histopathological images are cancerous or not.
3. If a deep learning model can be created to accurately classify lung tissue histopathological images into one of three classes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or benign.

### Datasets used in this project
  #### Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) Images
  The Brain Tumor MRI scans are from a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri).   The scans contain images with four different labels â€“ glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.  The images can also be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oLa6T7Bua6nUEbm97Vggz3jQ1hg4ALDx?).
  #### Lung Cancer Histopathological Images
  The Lung Cancer Images are from a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images). The scans contain images with three different labels: lung adenocarcinoma (lung_aca), lung squamous cell carcinomas (lung_scc), and lung benign (lung_benign). The images can also be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14tG6gHRl0exJANZg3xa6JFUT1Xi8RH-a).
  #### Colon Cancer Histopathological Images  
  The Colon Cancer Images are from a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images). The scans contain images with two different labels: colon adenocarcinoma (colon_aca) and colon benign (colon_benign). The images can also be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fT3wLL8gxKrBca7bJ910LwzS0kZAAFXZ).

### Methods
For each of the three datasets, the following models were created and evaluated:
1. A Convolutional neural network (CNN) model built from scratch using Keras.  
2. A CNN model built on top of the ResNet50 model architecture using the fastai library.
3. A CNN model built on top of the VGG19 model architecture using the fastai library.
